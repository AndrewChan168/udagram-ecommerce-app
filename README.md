# udagram-ecommerce-app
It is my capstone project of Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program. It is simulating the CMS part of an e-commerce platform in which everyone could create his/her own brand(s) and sell their products in this e-commerce platform.

This CMS part is divided into two parts:
- Backend
- Frontend

## Backend part 
The backend part is a serverless application which is hosted on AWS. Data of the application is stored in DynamoDB and file uploaded from client is stored in S3 bucket.

All the code is in folder `udagram-ecommerce-app-backend`.
